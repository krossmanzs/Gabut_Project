# Gabut Project
This is my repo I used for making gabut things :3

**Actually this is my school material, I made this because I find it difficult to memorize math formulas. Instead of memorizing it, it's better to make it in the form of a calculator :)**

## What's inside
- Polynomial Division: using the **horner** technique :)
- Making automatic f(x) function
- Update soon

It's free :) I haven't thought about it and haven't learned about the license too xd
